# CCO_Extensions
Extension Modules from the Common Core Ontologies

## Vehicle Manufacturing Extension

This module extends CCO to reason over vehicles, models, years, and manufacturer. I defined 'manufacturer' broadly enough to be easily extendable to other types of commodities than just vehicles. My core strategy is to assert that manufacturers like General Motors are instances of some cco:Organization that is the 'agent in' some Act of Artifact Processing.
